This chapter describes the API of the Python scripting module.

Such script can remote interact with any instrumented program with `Palanteer`, independently of the used language (C++ or Python at the moment).

Some typical usages are:
 - system tests
 - automatic performance extraction
 - monitoring
 - ...

This API aims at being simple to use. As multi-threading would introduce a lot of complexity for few benefits, calls are synchronous and poll rather than blocking.

!!!
    For a proper usage of monitoring in production, it is recommended to:
     - use a light instrumentation (using groups in C++, with only manual instrumentation in Python) to maintain the optimal program performances and limit the network flow
     - not record in a file at the same time. For ever-lasting runs, the limit of 2 billion events is bound to be reached.

!!! warning
    The module is not thread-safe, it is up to the user to add protections if multi-threading is really required.

## Exceptions

When the module encounters a non-recoverable problem, a specific exception is raised with an explanatory message. <br/>
This section presents the list of exceptions and when they are raised.

**InitializationError** is raised when calling an API which requires that the module is initialized and it is not:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
class InitializationError(Exception):
    """The Palanteer library has not been initialized. Use the function 'initialize_scripting'."""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**ConnectionError** is raised when calling an API which requires a connection to the instrumented program and there is none:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
class ConnectionError(Exception):
    """There is no connection to the program."""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**UnknownThreadError** is raised when calling program_step_continue with an unknown thread name:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
class UnknownThreadError(Exception):
    """The thread with the provided name is unknown."""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## Module initialization

### initialize_scripting

This function initializes the scripting module. It shall be called once before any other call.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# port    : the TCP port that is used to communicate with the instrumented program
# log_func: the logging function for the Palanteer library (debug)
# no returned value
def initialize_scripting(port=59059, log_func=_default_log_func)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default logging function prints warning or errors on stdout for debugging purposes. It can thus be overriden.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
_default_log_min_level = 2

def _default_log_func(level, msg):
    if level<_default_log_min_level:
        return
    date_str = datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%H:%M:%S.%f")[:-3]  # [:-3] to remove the microseconds
    level_str = "[%s]" % {0: "detail ", 1: "info   ", 2: "warning", 3: "error  "}.get(level, "unknown")
    print("%s %-9s %s" % (date_str, level_str, msg))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
initialize_scripting()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### uninitialize_scripting

This function uninitializes the scripting module.

If a launched program is still running, it is automatically stopped.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# no returned value
def uninitialize_scripting()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### set_external_strings

This function sets the lookup to convert an obfuscated strings into the original one.

It installs the union of the two sources, from a file and from a Python dictionary. <br/>
The lookup generation is explained [here](getting_started.md.html#quickc++externalstringconfiguration).

The string resolution is done at string reception time, so it is advised to install it before running a program. <br/>
The lookup is persistent until another one is installed.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# filename: the filename which contains the lookup content (text format)
# lkup: a Python 'dict'
def set_external_strings(filename=None, lkup={})
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
set_external_strings("lookup.txt")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!!
    Scripts work with hashed strings so without any lookup requirement. <br/>
    Even CLI calls are functional as the parameter specification is not obfuscated on program side. Moreover, the CLI answers are sent in clear because they are dynamic strings. <br/>
    So, registering a string lookup with this function is useful mainly for developers when debugging scripts, as non-obfuscated strings are required.


## Process

### process_launch

This function launches an instrumented program and connects to it.

If the connection fails or another program is already connected, a **ConnectionError** exception is raised.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# program_path   : path of the program to launch
# args           : list of command line arguments
# record_filename: filename for the record. Empty string means no storage
# pass_first_freeze_point: if True, returns only after first freeze point is met and released (kind of synchro)
# capture_output : if True, reads stdout and stderr and allows the user to poll them asynchronously
# cli_to_quit    : if not None, the CLI command to call to quit the application. If it fails, it falls back to other termination mechanisms
# connection_timeout_sec : timeout in second to have a connection with the program. After it expires, a ConnectionError exception is triggered
# no returned value
def process_launch(program_path, args=[], record_filename="", pass_first_freeze_point=False, capture_output=False, cli_to_quit=None, connection_timeout_sec=5.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
process_launch("./build/bin/testprogram", ["collect"], capture_output=True)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### process_connect

This function connects to an externally launched instrumented program, which should use the option "wait for server".

If the connection fails or another program is already connected, a **ConnectionError** exception is raised.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# record_filename: filename for the record. Empty string means no storage
# pass_first_freeze_point: if True, returns only after first freeze point is met and released (kind of synchro)
# cli_to_quit            : if not None, the CLI command to call to quit the application. If it fails, it falls back to other termination mechanisms
# connection_timeout_sec : timeout in second to have a connection with the program. After it expires, a ConnectionError exception is triggered
# no returned value
def process_connect(record_filename="", pass_first_freeze_point=False, cli_to_quit=None, connection_timeout_sec=5.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
process_connect()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### process_is_running

This function provides the state of the launched program:

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# state: boolean state True if running, False if not launched or exited
state = process_is_running()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
while process_is_running():
    ... # Do something
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! warning
    Be aware that a process may not be running anymore but some events still in the processing pipe and not yet visible to the script.

### process_get_returncode

This function provides the return code of the launched program if finished, else `None`

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# returncode: process return code if finished, else None
returncode = process_get_returncode()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
if not process_is_running():
    print("Exit status is: %d" % process_get_returncode())
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### process_get_stderr_lines

This function returns the currently received stderr output in case the program has been launched with the parameter `capture_output=True`.

This output is buffered in memory waiting for the next call. The buffer is cleared after the call.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# lines: a list of strings (one per line)
lines = process_get_stderr_lines()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
lines = process_get_stderr_lines()
if lines:
    print("\n".join(lines))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### process_get_stdout_lines

This function returns the currently received stdout output in case the program has been launched with the parameter `capture_output=True`.

This output is buffered in memory waiting for the next call. The buffer is cleared after the call.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# lines: a list of strings (one per line)
lines = process_get_stdout_lines()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
lines = process_get_stdout_lines()
if lines:
    print("\n".join(lines))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### process_stop

This function "terminates" a launched program with the following mechanisms in order, until the process is effectively ended:

  1. using the "quit" CLI optionally provided as a program launch parameter (see [process_launch](#process_launch))
  1. using the "terminate" signal (SIG_TERM) which let a chance to the program for finishing gracefully
  1. using the "kill" signal (SIG_KILL) which is merciless and cannot fail


The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# no returned value
def process_stop()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
process_stop()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! Note Automatic cleaning
    Any running instrumented program is stopped when the `palanteer` module is uninitialized or when the python script exits (except with SIG_KILL...). <br/>
    This property prevents pollution by zombie processes in case of script crash for instance.


## Program

This set of commands is functional only if the instrumented program was not compiled with the flag `PL_NOCONTROL` set to 1. <br/>
Indeed, this directive explicitly removes the remote control feature, leaving only the observation part.

### program_cli

This function calls a remote [CLI (Command Line Interface)](base_concepts.md.html#commandlineinterface) to be executed on the instrumented program side.

The input is a string which contains the command name and its parameters, see [here](base_concepts.md.html#clicommand) for full description.

The output is a tuple (`status`, `text_answer`). <br/>
A null status means a successful call, else a failure. In the latter case, the text_answer shall contain some details on the error.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# command_string: the command string including the command name and the parameters
# status        : status code integer value. 0 means success, else failure
# text_answer   : text answer from the command. In case of failure, shall contain some details on the error
status, text_answer = program_cli(command_string)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
status, text_answer = palanteer.program_cli("config:setRange min=300 max=500")
if status!=0:
  print("Error: %s" % text_answer)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### program_set_freeze_mode

This function controls the "freeze mode" state on the program side. <br/>
If enabled, each thread of the program hitting a `plFreezePoint()` call is stopped, waiting for an order from the script to continue (either disabling the freeze mode, either using `program_step_continue`)

The typical usage is to control the dynamic of the program to safely change its configuration or stimulate it. This can be associated to a dedicated event filtering.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# state: boolean
# no returned value
def program_set_freeze_mode(state)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
program_set_freeze_mode(True)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### program_get_frozen_threads

This function returns the list of names of the currently frozen threads.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
frozen_thread_list = program_get_frozen_threads()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
for thread_name in program_get_frozen_threads():
    print(thread_name)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### program_wait_freeze

This function returns the frozen threads among the provided ones either as soon as all provided threads are frozen, either because the timeout expired.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# thread_names      : list of names of threads that we expect to be frozen before the timeout
# timeout_sec       : maximum duration in second to wait for all provided threads to be frozen.
# frozen_thread_list: list of names of the frozen threads restricted to the list of provided ones as input (the list can be a string in case of only 1 thread)
frozen_thread_list = program_wait_freeze(thread_names, timeout_sec=1.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
if program_wait_freeze("Workers/Worker 1", 0.2):
  ... # Call a CLI (for instance)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### program_step_continue

This function releases a selection of "frozen" threads from their current freezing point. It has an effect only on the frozen threads. <br/>
If one of the input thread is unknown, an `UnknownThreadError` exception is raised. <br/>
After sending the command to the remote program, the function waits up to the timeout that each thread changes its frozen state.

!!!
    The function is robust to the ABA problem.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# status: True if all input threads have changed their state, else False
status =  program_step_continue(thread_names, timeout_sec=1.)  # Note: the list can be a string in case of only 1 thread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
program_step_continue(["Workers/Worker 1", "Main"])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## Data

This set of commands is functional only if the instrumented program was not compiled with the flag `PL_NOEVENT` set to 1. <br/>
Indeed, this directive explicitly removes the code of the events generation, leaving only the control part (CLIs).

### data_collect_events

This function returns the list of the received events from the selected ones.

This list is cleared after being returned, so only new events are provided. It is also cleared when calling `events_clear_buffered` or `data_configure_events`.

The call to `data_collect_events()` returns only when at least one of these conditions is met (see parameters in [`data_configure_events`](#data_configure_events)):

  * all the `wanted` events have been seen at least once
  * one of the `unwanted` events has been seen once
  * all the threads listed in `frozen_threads` are frozen
  * the quantity of received events is at least `max_event_qty`
  * the call lasted at least `timeout_sec` seconds
  * the program is no more running

Only the events selected with [`data_configure_events`](#data_configure_events) are received, in chronological order of the parent's end date (if any parent).

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# wanted:         stops the event collection as soon as all event names in this list are found (order does not matter)
# unwanted:       stops the event collection as soon as one event name in this list is found
# frozen_threads: stops the event collection as soon as all provided threads are frozen
# max_event_qty:  stops the event collection as soon as this quantity of event is collected
# timeout_sec  :  stops the event collection as soon as the function duration exceeds this timeout
# events: a list of collected Evt objects sorted by "end date"
events = data_collect_events(wanted=[], unwanted=[], frozen_threads=[], max_event_qty=None, timeout_sec=1.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
for e in palanteer.data_collect_events(unwanted=["Error"], frozen_threads=["Main"]):
    print(e)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Evt object has the following fields:
| Field    | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ---      | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| thread   | thread name                                                                                                                         |
| kind     | the type of event, among `data`, `marker`, `lock use`, `lock wait`, `lock ntf`                                                      |
| path     | a list of names from the root event to the captured event name. The event name is always path[-1]                                   |
| value    | the value of the event. The type depends on the event. For "scopes", the value is the duration in nanosecond                        |
| date_ns  | the event date in nanosecond. The origin is the date of the connection to the program                                               |
| spec_id  | the event spec index in the configuration list where this event comes from (see [`data_configure_events`](#data_configure_events))) |
| children | a list of nested events if the event is a "hierarchical parent"                                                                     |

!!! tip
    There is **at most** one depth level with children by construction of the event specs (see [`data_configure_events`](#data_configure_events))


### data_clear_buffered_events

This function clears the buffered event waiting in the module for a polling call to [`data_collect_events`](#data_collect_events).

It is "deeper" than a dummy call to [`data_collect_events`](#data_collect_events) (i.e. and ignoring its content) because it also clears the events buffered inside the dynamic library.

Its typical use is to start a fresh scenario after an unsynchronized CLI call which affects the generated events.

!!!
    Configuring a new set of event specs also "deeply" clears all previously buffered events.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# no returned value
def data_clear_buffered_events()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of call is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
data_clear_buffered_events()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


### data_configure_events

This function configures the subsequent reception of events via [`data_collect_events`](#data_collect_events). This configuration includes both the polling process and the content of the event list.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# specs: list of EvtSpec objects defining the selection of events
def data_configure_events(specs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Definition:** An `EvtSpec` is a specification of a simplified subtree of the event hierarchy of a particular thread, as defined in the instrumented program. <br/>
Its parameters are:

  * thread_name: thread name
  * events: list of event "path" (see exact definition below)
  * parent: an optional parent event path

Example of usage:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# Specify an EvtSpec. It can be prepared in advance and reused multiple time
my_selection = palanteer.EvtSpec(thread="MyThread", events=["first event", "top event/**/child event", "value"], parent="Task/Top node")

# Apply the event selection from now on
palanteer.data_configure_events(my_selection)  # Note: with 1 event spec, the list can be replaced by the lonely spec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!!
    The configuration function accepts a list of `EvtSpec` objects so that several use cases can be processed at the same time. <br/>
    The collected `Evt` object contains the field `spec_id` which refers to the event spec index in this list.

**Definition:** An event path is a way to specify the location of an event in the hierarchical tree. <br/>
Its format is similar to Unix paths: an ordered list of event name separated with a slash '/'.

  * `*` is a wildcard for 1 level. It shall be used alone (not a wildcard on a part of the name)
    * A wildcard can be used for a thread or event name
    * Example: "`Tasks/*/iteration number`"
  * `**` is a wildcard for any quantity of levels
    * It has no effect when first item in the path (ex: "`**/event name`" is equivalent to "`event name`")
    * Example: "`Tasks/**/iteration number`"
  * `.` forces the location to match the root (either the parent for an element with parent, or the tree root in other cases)
    * It has no effect if not the first item in the path (ex: "`Tasks/./Sub Task`" is equivalent to "`Tasks/Sub Task`"
    * Example: ".`/Tasks/iteration number`"

When no parent event path is specified, the corresponding return list via [`data_collect_events`](#data_collect_events) is a flat list of "chronological" (see note below) events without children.

When a parent event path is specified, the corresponding return list is a list of "chronological" parent events whose field `children` is a flat list of chronological instances of the specified events under it in the event tree. <br/>

!!! note About "chronological"
    The date of an event is either the one of the event if it owns one, either the start date of the parent (which is a scope by design so always has a start date). <br/>
    The chronological ordering follows these dates with the important exception of scopes where the **scope end date** is used. The reason is that the scope is "complete" and usable only when its end is known, and is stored only at that moment.

Using a parent event path is an implicit and easy way to associate some event instances. <br/>
To work properly with this concept, the following points are important to note:

  * all event paths shall be located inside the parent path
  * if the parent path is ambiguous for a particular event, the one closest to the root is taken
  * all event paths shall have the same "resolved" parent path  (see exact definition below)

**Definition:** Resolving a path means confronting and successfully matching an event path as specified above with the time-evolving tree of the instrumented program. It is intrinsically a dynamic process. <br/>
A resolution does not always occurs, due to inadequate specified event path or due to some not met dynamic condition to generate such event. <br/>
When investigating a resolution failure during a script creation, some valuable hints are provided by the command [`data_get_unresolved_events`](#data_get_unresolved_events).

!!! warning Important
    As all mechanisms are based on hashed strings, all event names shall be exactly as written in the code, including case, spaces and units.

[Example of event tree generated during the execution of the dynamic program for a thread "Worker"]

The tree above contains events with names as a letter for clarity. Note that these names are reused (on purpose) in different locations of the tree. <br/>
Based on this tree, below are some example of event specifications and their result in comment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
EvtSpec(thread="Worker", events=["A", "D", "I", "K"])         # => selects individually A, D(1), D(2), D(3), I(1), I(2) and K

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", parent="A", events=["D", "I", "K"])  # => selects A as parent, D(1), D(2), I(1) and K.  I(2) has a non matching parent

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", parent="A", events=["D/D", "K"])     # => selects A as parent, D(2) and K.    D(1) has a non matching event path

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", parent="A", events=["*/D", "K"])     # => selects A as parent, D(2) and K.    D(1) event path is not matching because 1 level is missing below the parent

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", parent="A", events=["./D", "K"])     # => selects A as parent, D(1) and K.    D(2) is not matching because of the "." constraint

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", parent="A", events=["B/**/K"])       # => selects A as parent, and K(1).      K(2) has a non matching event path

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", parent="D/D", events=["K"])          # => selects A as parent, and K(2).

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", parent="A/*/D", events=["K"])        # => selects D(2) as parent, and K(2).

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", parent="D", events=["K"])            # => selects D(1) as parent, and K(2).   The closest parent of the root is always selected.

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", parent="D/D", events=["K"])          # => selects D(2) as parent, and K(2).

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", parent="./D", events=["K"])          # => selects D(2) as parent, and K(3).   Only L(3) has a parent matching the "." constraint

EvtSpec(thread="Worker", events=["./D/*"])                    # => selects individually I(2), J and K(3). Only D(3) has a parent matching the "." constraint

### hash_string

This function returns the `Palanteer` hash of the provided string. Its typical usage is debugging scripts with the external string feature enabled.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# string_to_hash: the string to hash
# is_short_hash:  32 bits hash if set to True (default is 64 bits)
hash = hash_string(string_to_hash, is_short_hash=False):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example of usage:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# Creating a "manual" external string lookup
set_external_strings(lkup={hash_string("Add fruit"): "Add fruit", hash_string("CRASH"): "CRASH"})
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### data_get_unresolved_events

This function returns unresolved event specs configured with [`data_configure_events`](#data_configure_events). <br/>
It is typically used to investigate a specification issue.

It reports information up to 32 unresolved events. <br/>
The information is kept after a process is finished, but is cleared when a new event spec configuration is set.

The declaration is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
# unresolved_event_info_list: list of triplet (spec_id, event_spec, explanation message) for all unresolved event specifications
unresolved_event_info_list = data_get_unresolved_events()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example of usage:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
def debug_print_unresolved_events():
    unresolved_event = data_get_unresolved_events()
    print("Unresolved events (%d):" % len(unresolved_event))
    for spec_id, event_spec, msg in unresolved_event:
        print("  - From spec #%d, %s for event '%s'" % (spec_id, msg, event_spec))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Troubleshooting

**My test is not always giving the same result when run in a loop**

Some actions require strict synchronization to be reliable. In particular:
  - Declare CLIs before starting the instrumentation library, to avoid any remote call before they are known.
  - Use the freeze point feature for precise control of the moment of stimulation.
  - Clear the previously collected events before any experiment, if they have a possibility to interfere
    - Setting a new filter specification does it automatically
  - Use the adequate trigger for end of event collection end from `data_collect_events`

<br/>
**A CLI is failing because it is not known. But it is present in my code**

The CLI may be present in the code but not declared yet on the remote program side. <br/>
Declaring the CLI before the start of the instrumentation library is a good habit and fully prevent this kind of issues.

<br/>
**I have hard times debugging my script**

Here are some advises:
 - Use the debugging helpers
   -  The most useful in probably `debug_print_unresolved_events()` which tells you which Event Specification was not matched in the record and why.
 - Set the recording log level (module variable) to zero (all is displayed), with `palanteer_scripting.default_log_min_level = 0`
 - Record in a file while the script is executing, then check in the viewer that the targeted events are really present and with the expected structure.

<br/>
** I cannot retrieve marker events**

Ensure that the EvtSpec refers to the category of the marker, not to its message (which is the event "value").

<br/>
**Is it ok to have several events with the same name?**

Name collisions are ok, if the "path" in the tree is different, they will be seen as different event kinds. <br/>
However, it makes it harder for humans to visualize them, or point on a particular one in a script, as the usage of "parent" is then mandatory.
